        ### 🔍 Welcome, Detective
        
        A murder has been committed in SQL City, and you've been called to solve the case. 
        
        Your only lead is that the crime occurred on **January 15, 2018**, but the crime scene report has gone missing.
        Using your detective skills and SQL knowledge, you must:
        
        1. Query the police database to find relevant information
        2. Follow leads by asking the right questions
        3. Connect the dots to identify the killer
        
        Type your investigation queries in natural language, and the system will:
        - Translate your questions to SQL
        - Search the database
        - Help you analyze the results
        
        Can you solve the mystery before the trail goes cold?
